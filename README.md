+ My name is MM but i usually get called *freaky* haibara (or haibara) by my friends cause it's the skin im most known for >_<
-  I go by any pronouns, but i mainly use he/him. i don't mind you calling me something else!!
-  usually in the jjk area, but I'll move places time to time.
  
*say my name 3 times and i'll draw in your strawpage K̶A̶K̶A̶K̶A̶K̶A̶K̶A̶K̶A̶K̶A̶*

## things you should know before interacting me ✶⋆.˚->
- when i spot you online, i will almost always interact first, either whispering you or chatting to you directly ^_^
- when the conversation is dying i'll yap a ton of random stuff so i hope you don't mind.
- my sense of humor (like brainrot; skibidi and 18+ jokes) is kind of wacky so if it's not something you like please tell!!
- i am a fast typer so i hope you can understand the typos time to time!
- i'm a walking jjk spoiler so.. watch out!
> *do tell me when i said something innapropiate/offensive. i'm eager to learn and i'll change my ways!!*
 - > also, i might get distracted and go on pinterest (or other website) for hours and end up leaving you alone on ponytown, so my bad.. 😞

## DNI (DO NOT BOTHER INTERACTING ME IF: .....) 
- DNI IF YOU'RE RACIST, HOMOPHOBIC, A PROSHIPPER (especially any minor with sukuna and incest ships..), people who call me a a faggot in my strawpage like actually fuck off, A GENUINE WEIRDO AND ETC. SHOO SHOO YOU CREEP😬!!
- > also don't roleplay with me suddenly unless we're close friends

## and that's about it! thanks for reading all the way here!
