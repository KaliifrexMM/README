## things you should know before interacting me ✶⋆.˚->
- when i spot you online, i will almost always interact first, either whispering you or chatting to you directly ^_^
- when the conversation is dying i'll yap a ton of random stuff so i hope you don't mind.
- my sense of humor is kind of wacky so if it's not something you like please tell!!
do tell me when i said something innapropiate/offensive. i'm eager to learn and i'll change my ways!!
 - > i might get distracted and go on pinterest (or other website) for hours and end up leaving you alone on ponytown, so my bad 😞
