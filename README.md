## things you should know before interacting me ✶⋆.˚->
- when i spot you online, i will almost always interact first, either whispering you or chatting to you directly ^_^
- when the conversation is dying i'll yap a ton of random stuff so i hope you don't mind.
- > i might get distracted and go on pinterest (or other website) for hours and end up leaving you alone on ponytown 😞
